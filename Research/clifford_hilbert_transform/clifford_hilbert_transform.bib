	abstract = {As was shown by Lassas and Uhlmann [Ann. Sci. E´cole Norm. Sup. (4), 34 (2001), pp. 771–787], the smooth two-dimensional compact orientable Riemann manifold with the boundary is uniquely determined by its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (DN-map) up to conformal equivalence. We give a new proof of this fact based on relations between the Calderon problem and function algebras: the manifold is identiﬁed with the spectrum of the algebra of holomorphic functions determined by the DN-map up to isometry; as such, the manifold is recovered from the DN-map by the use of the Gelfand transform. A simple formula linking the DN-map to the Euler characteristic of the manifold is derived.},

Cliﬀord analysis, also known as the theory of monogenic functions, is a multidimensional function theory, which is at the same time a generalization of the theory of holomorphic functions in the complex plane and a reﬁnement of classical harmonic analysis. It oﬀers a framework which is particularly suited for the integrated treatment of higher dimensional phenomena, without having to rely on tensorial approaches.},

We synthesize the two different approaches to deﬁning this operator by giving an invariant deﬁnition of the complete Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for differential forms in terms of two linear operators Φ and Ψ . The pair (Φ, Ψ ) is equivalent to Joshi and Lionheart’s operator Π and determines Belishev and Sharafutdinov’s operator Λ. We show that the Betti numbers of the manifold are determined by Φ and that Ψ determines a chain complex whose homologies are explicitly related to the cohomology groups of the manifold.},

In the ﬁrst part [3] the Schwarz, the Dirichlet, and the Neumann problems are treated for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equation. The fundamental tools are the Gauss theorem and the Cauchy-Pompeiu representation. The principle of iterating these representation formulas is introduced which will enable treating higher order equations. Those are studied in a second part of these lectures.},

	abstract = {As is well-known, there is a close and well-defined connection between the notions of Hilbert transform and of conjugate harmonic functions in the context of the complex plane. This holds e.g. in the case of the Hilbert transform on the real line, which is linked to conjugate harmonicity in the upper (or lower) half plane. It also can be rephrased when dealing with the Hilbert transform on the boundary of a simply connected domain related to conjugate harmonics in its interior (or exterior). In this paper, we extend these principles to higher dimensional space, more specifically, in a Clifford analysis setting. We will show that the intimate relation between both concepts remains, however giving rise to a range of possibilities for the definition of either new Hilbert-like transforms, or specific notions of conjugate harmonicity.
