The motivating problem 

The BC method essentially consists of two main parts: Recovering the algebra of holomorphic functions and determining the homeomorphism type of the manifold.  The algebra of holomorphic functions provides a path towards finding the complex structure on the manifold. By knowing the complex structure on a surface, one can then determine (locally?) the Hodge star operator and determine the desired metric so long as the manifold is known up to homeomorphism. Then, using theory from Gelfand for commutative Banach algebras, one can relate the topology of the manifold to the topologized spectrum of the algebra of holomorphic functions.
