	abstract = {As was shown by Lassas and Uhlmann [Ann. Sci. E´cole Norm. Sup. (4), 34 (2001), pp. 771–787], the smooth two-dimensional compact orientable Riemann manifold with the boundary is uniquely determined by its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (DN-map) up to conformal equivalence. We give a new proof of this fact based on relations between the Calderon problem and function algebras: the manifold is identiﬁed with the spectrum of the algebra of holomorphic functions determined by the DN-map up to isometry; as such, the manifold is recovered from the DN-map by the use of the Gelfand transform. A simple formula linking the DN-map to the Euler characteristic of the manifold is derived.},

Algebra E is generated by the so-called eikonals, which are self-adjoint operators related with reachable sets of the system. Its structure is the main subject of the paper. We show that E is a direct sum of ”elementary blocks”. Each block is an algebra of operators, which multiply Rn-valued functions by continuous matrix-valued functions of special kind. The eikonal algebra is determined by the boundary inverse data. This shows promise of its possible applications to inverse problems.},

	abstract = {Hodge theory is a standard tool in characterizing differ- ential complexes and the topology of manifolds. This book is a study of the Hodge-Kodaira and related decompositions on manifolds with boundary under mainly analytic aspects. It aims at developing a method for solving boundary value problems. Analysing a Dirichlet form on the exterior algebra bundle allows to give a refined version of the classical decomposition results of Morrey. A projection technique leads to existence and regularity theorems for a wide class of boundary value problems for differential forms and vector fields. The book links aspects of the geometry of manifolds with the theory of partial differential equations. It is intended to be comprehensible for graduate students and mathematicians working in either of these fields.},

Given a bounded region Ω in space, a diffeomorphism Ψ from Ω to itself which restricts to the identity on ∂ Ω, and a conductivity γ on Ω, it is easy to construct a new conductivity Ψ*γ which will produce the same voltage and current measurements on ∂ Ω. We prove the converse in two dimensions (i.e., if γ1 and γ2 produce the same boundary measurements, then γ1, = Ψ*γ2 for an appropriate Ψ) for conductivities which are near a constant.},

@article{berry_spectral_2020,
	title = {Spectral exterior calculus},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01209},
	abstract = {A spectral approach to building the exterior calculus in manifold learning problems is developed. The spectral approach is shown to converge to the true exterior calculus in the limit of large data. Simultaneously, the spectral approach decouples the memory requirements from the amount of data points and ambient space dimension. To achieve this, the exterior calculus is reformulated entirely in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator on functions. The exterior derivatives of these eigenfunctions (and their wedge products) are shown to form a frame (a type of spanning set) for appropriate \$L{\textasciicircum}2\$ spaces of \$k\$-forms, as well as higher-order Sobolev spaces. Formulas are derived to express the Laplace-de Rham operators on forms in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian on functions. By representing the Laplace-de Rham operators in this frame, spectral convergence results are obtained via Galerkin approximation techniques. Numerical examples demonstrate accurate recovery of eigenvalues and eigenforms of the Laplace-de Rham operator on 1-forms. The correct Betti numbers are obtained from the kernel of this operator approximated from data sampled on several orientable and non-orientable manifolds, and the eigenforms are visualized via their corresponding vector fields. These vector fields form a natural orthonormal basis for the space of square-integrable vector fields, and are ordered by a Dirichlet energy functional which measures oscillatory behavior. The spectral framework also shows promising results on a non-smooth example (the Lorenz 63 attractor), suggesting that a spectral formulation of exterior calculus may be feasible in spaces with no differentiable structure.},
