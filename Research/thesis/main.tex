%        The problem of determining an unknown Riemannian manifold given the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) operator is known as the Calder\'on problem.  One method of solving this problem in the two dimensional case is through the Boundary Control method.  There, one uses the DN operator to construct a Banach algebra of holomorphic functions on the manifold. The Gelfand transform of this algebra is then homeomorphic to the manifold. In higher dimensions, we replace the complex field with a Clifford algebra and use the DN operator to determine a $\spingroup$ invariant space of monogenic multivector fields. Using a power series representation for monogenic fields, one decomposes the space of monogenics into products of commutative algebras of $(0+2)$-vector fields constant on translations of planes and monogenic in $\R^n$. Using this decomposition, we define spinor characters on the space of monogenic fields that correspond to Dirac measures on the manifold.  The set of these Dirac measures is then homeomorphic to the underlying manifold with the Gelfand topology.
