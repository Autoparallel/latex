	abstract = {As was shown by Lassas and Uhlmann [Ann. Sci. E´cole Norm. Sup. (4), 34 (2001), pp. 771–787], the smooth two-dimensional compact orientable Riemann manifold with the boundary is uniquely determined by its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (DN-map) up to conformal equivalence. We give a new proof of this fact based on relations between the Calderon problem and function algebras: the manifold is identiﬁed with the spectrum of the algebra of holomorphic functions determined by the DN-map up to isometry; as such, the manifold is recovered from the DN-map by the use of the Gelfand transform. A simple formula linking the DN-map to the Euler characteristic of the manifold is derived.},

Algebra E is generated by the so-called eikonals, which are self-adjoint operators related with reachable sets of the system. Its structure is the main subject of the paper. We show that E is a direct sum of ”elementary blocks”. Each block is an algebra of operators, which multiply Rn-valued functions by continuous matrix-valued functions of special kind. The eikonal algebra is determined by the boundary inverse data. This shows promise of its possible applications to inverse problems.},

This book is a study of the Hodge-Kodaira and related decompositions on manifolds with boundary under mainly analytic aspects. It aims at developing a method for solving boundary value problems. Analysing a Dirichlet form on the exterior algebra bundle allows to give a refined version of the classical decomposition results of Morrey. A projection technique leads to existence and regularity theorems for a wide class of boundary value problems for differential forms and vector fields. The book links aspects of the geometry of manifolds with the theory of partial differential equations. It is intended to be comprehensible for graduate students and mathematicians working in either of these fields.},

	title = {Spectral exterior calculus},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01209},
	abstract = {A spectral approach to building the exterior calculus in manifold learning problems is developed. The spectral approach is shown to converge to the true exterior calculus in the limit of large data. Simultaneously, the spectral approach decouples the memory requirements from the amount of data points and ambient space dimension. To achieve this, the exterior calculus is reformulated entirely in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator on functions. The exterior derivatives of these eigenfunctions (and their wedge products) are shown to form a frame (a type of spanning set) for appropriate \$L{\textasciicircum}2\$ spaces of \$k\$-forms, as well as higher-order Sobolev spaces. Formulas are derived to express the Laplace-de Rham operators on forms in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian on functions. By representing the Laplace-de Rham operators in this frame, spectral convergence results are obtained via Galerkin approximation techniques. Numerical examples demonstrate accurate recovery of eigenvalues and eigenforms of the Laplace-de Rham operator on 1-forms. The correct Betti numbers are obtained from the kernel of this operator approximated from data sampled on several orientable and non-orientable manifolds, and the eigenforms are visualized via their corresponding vector fields. These vector fields form a natural orthonormal basis for the space of square-integrable vector fields, and are ordered by a Dirichlet energy functional which measures oscillatory behavior. The spectral framework also shows promising results on a non-smooth example (the Lorenz 63 attractor), suggesting that a spectral formulation of exterior calculus may be feasible in spaces with no differentiable structure.},

In this article, we study the relationships among various ring-theoretic properties and topological conditions on Spec r (R) (with weak Zariski topology). A ring R is called Abelian if all idempotents in R are central (see Goodearl, 1991). A ring R is called 2-primal if every nilpotent element is in the prime radical of R (see Lam, 2001). It will be shown that for an Abelian ring R there is a bijection between the set of all idempotents in R and the clopen (i.e., closed and open) sets in Spec r (R). And the following results are obtained for any ring R: (1) For any clopen set U in Spec r (R), there is an idempotent e in R such that U = U r (eR). (2) If R is an Abelian ring or a 2-primal ring, then, for any idempotent e in R, U r (eR) is a clopen set in Spec r (R). (3) Spec r (R) is connected if and only if Spec(R) is connected.},

	title = {Introductory {Cliﬀord} analysis},
	abstract = {In this chapter an introduction is given to Cliﬀord analysis and the underlying Cliﬀord algebras. The functions under consideration are deﬁned on Euclidean space and take values in the universal real or complex Cliﬀord algebra, the structure and properties of which are also recalled in detail. The function theory is centered around the notion of a monogenic function, which is a null solution of a generalized Cauchy–Riemann operator, which is rotation invariant and factorizes the Laplace operator. In this way, Cliﬀord analysis may be considered both as a generalization to higher dimension of the theory of holomorphic functions in the complex plane and a reﬁnement of classical harmonic analysis. A notion of monogenicity may also be associated to the vectorial part of the Cauchy-Riemann operator, which is called the Dirac operator; some attention is paid to the intimate relation between both notions. Since a product of monogenic functions is, in general, no longer monogenic, it is crucial to possess some tools for generating monogenic functions: such tools are provided by Fueter’s theorem on the one hand and the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya extension theorem on the other. A corner stone in this function theory is the Cauchy integral formula for representation of a monogenic function in the interior of its domain of monogenicity. Starting from this representation formula and related integral formulae, it is possible to consider integral transforms such as Cauchy, Hilbert and Radon transforms, which are important both within the theoretical framework and in view of possible applications.},

	abstract = {This is the first entry in a planned series aiming to establish a modified, and simpler, formalism for studying the geometry of smooth manifolds with a metric, while remaining close to standard textbook treatments in terms of notation and concepts. The key step is extending the tangent space at each point from a vector space to a geometric algebra, which is a linear space incorporating vectors with dot and wedge multiplication, and extending the affine connection to a directional derivative acting naturally on fields of multivectors (elements of the geometric algebra). A short introduction to geometric algebra is included in the text. The theory that results from this extension is simpler and more powerful than either differential forms or tensor methods, in a number of ways. The multivector directional derivative obeys a powerful product rule. Simple conditions are obtained for metric-compatibility and torsion-freeness of the connection coefficients, and derivatives with torsion are treated generally. The covariant derivative of tensor fields is derived from a simple chain rule. Arbitrary metric signatures are treated in generality. The curved-manifold equivalents of the gradient, divergence, and curl operators are investigated, and the torsion-free curl is shown to be equivalent to the exterior derivative of differential forms. Unlike most traditional treatments, the entire formalism is developed in terms of completely arbitrary vector bases, which might be neither coordinate bases nor orthonormal. Methods of geometric algebra have previously been applied to vector calculus with great success, and extended to curved spaces in several ways (notably including ``vector manifolds'' and ``gauge theory gravity''). Here we provide a new way of extending geometric calculus to curved manifolds, which more closely parallels standard Riemannian geometry.},

	abstract = {Formulas relating dot and cross products of vectors to their angle are generalized for products of real or complex blades (simple multivectors). Their inner product and contraction are related to a Grassmann angle, the exterior product to a complementary Grassmann angle, and products of Cliﬀord geometric algebra are also linked to such angles. We interpret geometrically the Cliﬀord product of blades and some of its properties, relate it to an angle bivector, and give a formula for the exponential of any bivector in terms of Grassmann angles. The relations between such angles and blade products cast new light on both and reveal new properties.},

	abstract = {This is an introduction to geometric algebra, an alternative to traditional vector algebra that expands on it in two ways: 1. In addition to scalars and vectors, it defines new objects representing subspaces of any dimension. 2. It defines a product that's strongly motivated by geometry and can be taken between any two objects. For example, the product of two vectors taken in a certain way represents their common plane. This system was invented by William Clifford and is more commonly known as Clifford algebra. It's actually older than the vector algebra that we use today (due to Gibbs) and includes it as a subset. Over the years, various parts of Clifford algebra have been reinvented independently by many people who found they needed it, often not realizing that all those parts belonged in one system. This suggests that Clifford had the right idea, and that geometric algebra, not the reduced version we use today, deserves to be the standard "vector algebra." My goal in these notes is to describe geometric algebra from that standpoint and illustrate its usefulness. The notes are work in progress; I'll keep adding new topics as I learn them myself.},

We think the basis for a better arithmetic has long been available, but its versatility has hardly been appreciated, and it has not yet been integrated into the mainstream of mathematics. We refer to the system commonly called 'Clifford Algebra', though we prefer the name 'Geometric Algebm' suggested by Clifford himself. Many distinct algebraic systems have been adapted or developed to express geometric relations and describe geometric structures. Especially notable are those algebras which have been used for this purpose in physics, in particular, the system of complex numbers, the quatemions, matrix algebra, vector, tensor and spinor algebras and the algebra of differential forms. Each of these geometric algebras has some significant advantage over the others in certain applications, so no one of them provides an adequate algebraic structure for all purposes of geometry and physics. At the same time, the algebras overlap considerably, so they provide several different mathematical representations for individual geometrical or physical ideas.},

	abstract = {Let \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr A\}(D)\$ be an algebra of functions continuous in the disk \$D={\textbackslash}\{z{\textbackslash}in\{{\textbackslash}mathbb C\}{\textbackslash},{\textbar}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},{\textbar}z{\textbar}{\textbackslash}leqslant 1{\textbackslash}\}\$ and \{{\textbackslash}it holomorphic\} into \$D\$. The well-known fact is that the set \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr M\}\$ of its characters (homomorphisms \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr A\}(D){\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}mathbb C\$) is exhausted by the Dirac measures \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}delta\_\{z\_0\}{\textbackslash},{\textbar}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},z\_0{\textbackslash}in D{\textbackslash}\}\$ and a homeomorphism \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr M\}{\textbackslash}cong D\$ holds. We present a 3d analog of this classical result as follows. Let \$B={\textbackslash}\{x{\textbackslash}in\{{\textbackslash}mathbb R\}{\textasciicircum}3{\textbackslash},{\textbar}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},{\textbar}x{\textbar}{\textbackslash}leqslant 1{\textbackslash}\}\$. A quaternion field is a pair \$p={\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}alpha,u{\textbackslash}\}\$ of a function \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and vector field \$u\$ in the ball \$B\$. A field \$p\$ is \{{\textbackslash}it harmonic\} if \${\textbackslash}alpha, u\$ are continuous in \$B\$ and \${\textbackslash}nabla{\textbackslash}alpha=\{{\textbackslash}rm rot{\textbackslash},\}u,{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm div{\textbackslash},\}u=0\$ holds into \$B\$. The space \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr Q\}(B)\$ of such fields is not an algebra w.r.t. the relevant (point-wise quaternion) multiplication. However, it contains the commutative algebras \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr A\}\_{\textbackslash}omega(B)={\textbackslash}\{p{\textbackslash}in\{{\textbackslash}mathscr Q\}(B){\textbackslash},{\textbar}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}nabla\_{\textbackslash}omega{\textbackslash}alpha=0,{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}nabla\_{\textbackslash}omega u=0{\textbackslash}\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},({\textbackslash}omega{\textbackslash}in S{\textasciicircum}2)\$, each \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr A\}\_{\textbackslash}omega(B)\$ being isometrically isomorphic to \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr A\}(D)\$. This enables one to introduce a set \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr M\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbb H\}\$ of the \${\textbackslash}mathbb H\$-valued linear functionals on \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr Q\}(B)\$ (\{{\textbackslash}it \${\textbackslash}mathbb H\$-characters\}), which are multiplicative on each \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr A\}\_{\textbackslash}omega(B)\$, and prove that \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr M\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbb H\}={\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}delta{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbb H\}\_\{x\_0\}{\textbackslash},{\textbar}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},x\_0{\textbackslash}in B{\textbackslash}\}{\textbackslash}cong B\$, where \${\textbackslash}delta{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbb H\}\_\{x\_0\}(p)=p(x\_0)\$.},

In this paper we bridge the gap by showing that classical integral-geometric formulas such as those of Crofton, Cauchy, and Chern can be easily and systematically obtained through the study of Radon-type transforms on double fibrations. The methods also allow us to extend these formulas to non-homogeneous settings where group-theoretic techniques are no longer useful. To illustrate this point, we construct all Finsler metrics on projective space such that hyperplanes are area-minimizing and extend the theory of Crofton densities developed by Busemann, Pogorelov, Gelfand, and Smirnov.Pensar es olvidar diferencias. . .Jorge Luis Borges},

	abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to describe the settings in which one can set up coherent generalizations to several variables of the classical single variable complex analysis and to point out some basic properties of the function spaces that naturally occur in such settings. Particular emphasis is placed on defining proper counterparts in higher dimension of the concept of holomorphic functions and of the Cauchy–Riemann operator. The resulting function theory deals with monogenic functions and Euclidean Dirac or Cauchy–Riemann operators. Its richness is illustrated by the existence of a general Cauchy–Pompeiu Integral Representation Formula. Actually, even more general formulas will be initially derived for first order homogeneous differential operators with constant coefficients in a unital associative Banach algebra. The point that will be made is that the operators and algebras that yield the simplest forms of such Integral Representation Formulas with Remainders are essentially the Cauchy–Riemann and Dirac operators associated with Euclidean Clifford algebras. As yet another generalization of a classical result in single variable complex analysis one gets a Quantitative Hartogs–Rosenthal Theorem concerned with uniform approximation on compact sets by monogenic functions. An equally important goal of the chapter is to outline some of the contributions that led to the discovery and development of Quaternion and Clifford analysis. The last section includes several concluding remarks and a few additional references that outline the full scope of some of the early and current developments, and help in further explorations of other lines of research in quaternion and Clifford analysis.},

	abstract = {In [4] Fueter describes a method for characterizing homogeneous polynomial solutions to the quaternionic analogue of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. In [3] Delanghe demonstrates that this method may be generalized to characterize homogeneous polynomial solutions to a generalized Cauchy-Riemann equation defined over a Clifford algebra. The function theory associated with this particular equation has been extensively pursued in recent years by a number of authors (eg [2,5,7,8,9,10]). However, the author shows in [7] that the methods used in [3,4] may be extended to characterize homogeneous polynomial solutions to homogeneous, first order, constant coefficient differential equations defined over arbitrary, finite dimensional, associative algebras with identity. For this reason it would appear desirable to find another method to characterize these solutions, to generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations over Clifford algebras, which is more closely aligned to the properties of Clifford algebras.In this paper another approach is adopted to characterize homogeneous polynomial solutions, in even dimensions, of the equations considered by Delanghe in [3]. It is demonstrated that these polynomials form an orthogonal basis with respect to the inner product introduced, by Sommen [8] for solutions to the homogeneous Dirac equation in Rn. Moreover, the method used here to introduce the inner product makes use of a natural automorphism within the Clifford algebra and bypasses the inversion transform employed in [8]. We also show that these basis elements contain all homogeneous polynomial solutions to the split Dirac equations described by Sommen in [9]. We conclude by giving a local characterization of the solutions to these split Dirac equations in terms of canonical isomorphisms between Clifford algebras and tensor products of lower dimensional Clifford algebras.},

We will give a representation formula of the second kind using differential forms. Another topic is the study of the domains of bi- regularity which are the analogues of the domains of holomorphy of complex analysis. We will make it clear that multi-valued functions cannot be avoided in this study. Some examples of domains of biregula- rity will be given, by constructing biregular functions in the domains which cannot be extended to any larger domain.},

Grassmann algebra with the (pseudo-) Riemannian structure (including degenerate case), or with the (pre-) symplectic structure, or with the Hermitian (Hilbert) structure, contain the corresponding Riemannian or symplectic or Hermitian Clifford algebra. 2. Grassmann algebra is the tautology of the formalism of the (multi-) fermion and antifermion creation and annihilation operators. This relation does not need at all to fix any kind of the Riemannian (Euclidean) or Hilbertian, Hermitian, etc, structures. 3. Clifford algebra is the tautology of the formalism of the quasi-particles in nuclear physics and therefore can be viewed as the Bogoliubov transformation of the Grassmann algebra. 4. The last two statements open wide possibilities of the applications of the Grassmann and Hermitian Clifford algebras particularly to nucleons and quarks in the nuclear shell theory. 5. The Clifford product can always be reexpressed in terms of the fermion creation and annihilation operators. 6. It is interesting that symplectic Clifford algebras has not yet been explored in the classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics.},

Such spinors are called pure. Chevalley later gave a thorough treatment of pure spinors. In Cartan’s treatment the vector space was over the complex field. Chevalley allowed an arbitrary field but assumed the quadratic form to be of maximal index (i.e. the totally isotropic subspaces have the largest possible dimension). I will firstly show how the notion of pure spinors may be extended to the case of a real vector space whose metric has a signature with r + 2 (r) plus (minus) signs; the pure spinors being in correspondence with oriented isotropic (r + l)-planes. For r = 1 all spinors are pure. As an example of how this may be used I shall show how to find Lorentzian manifolds for which the Kahler equation admits spinorial solutions. Similarly all Lorentzian manifolds admitting parallel spinors may be found, giving possible background geometries for supersymmetry.},

This new equation, invented by Sauter, provides a framework in which only the algebraic properties of the matrix operators and wave functions are needed for all calculations in relativistic quantum mechanics.},

The formulation provides examples of physical quantities which can be usefully described by multivector aggregates, i.e. sums of unlike geometries. The equation of motion of the harmonic oscillator is “geometrized” by being factored into a first order multivector differential equation. This is analogous to factoring the (relativistic) Klein-Gordon equation into the linear Dirac equation by the use of Dirac matrices. The solution is a special “geometric phasor”, which is analogous to the complex phasor of standard theory, however the timelike vector eO, replaces the usual imaginary “1”. The geometric phasor is reinterpreted as a vector in a particular two- dimensional subalgebra which has the properties of a geometric phase space. Clifford Algebraic velocity (timelike bivector) and position are found to be naturally perpendicular in the phase space.A single multivector conservation equation containing all the conserved quantities of the system is derived directly from the multivector equation of motion. The formulation is a classical discrete mechanical analog of the relativistic quantum results put forward by Greider3 and Ross2. A continuum generalization allows for a R(4) formulation Dirac theory. The R(4) algebra [of spacetime] used here is one dimension less than the C(4) [five dimensional] algebra used in standard Dirac theory.},

The continuity equations must yield physically meaningful conservation laws in order to produce classical fields which also are physically meaningful and correct. Specifically, the charge-current conservation equation leads directly to the correct classical Maxwell electromagnetic equations if the sign of the charge is indefinite. Similarly, the energy-momentum conservation equation leads to a classical theory of gravity if the sign of the energy tensor is positive-definite. The equations obtained, although very different from those of general relativity, agree with all the current gravitation experiments.},

While it is necessary to use Clifford algebra in quantum mechanics in splitting up the Schrödinger equation to get the Dirac equation, it is not necessary to use Clifford algebra in electromagnetic theory or network theory. However, as Clifford algebra is the natural tool to use in connection with, for example, the Minkowski model of Lorentz space, it is quite useful in studying problems dealing with partially polarized waves (the Stokes vector), active, lossy, and noisy networks, etc. Some applications of Clifford algebra in electromagnetic theory and network theory will be discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper presents some points of comparison between Grassmann and Clifford algebras in their applications to electromagnetics. The Grassmann algebra applies directly to (exterior) differential forms leading to Cartan’s calculus. Forms of various degrees correspond most naturally to electromagnetic quantities and their relations are expressed by means of the exterior differential operator d.These relations are conveniently represented either in space or space-time by flow diagrams. They reveal the existence of potentials (Poincaré’s Lemma), the independence from coordinate systems, and the role of the metric. All of these properties are briefly reviewed. A calculus for functions having their values in a Clifford algebra can also be developed based on the Dirac operator D, whose square is a generalized Laplacian. Besides its role in Dirac’s theory of the electron, this Clifford calculus can also be adapted to electromagnetics, although less directly than with Cartan’s calculus. The point of departure is the role of a metric in a Clifford algebra. This can be remedied by introducing the Hodge star operator in the Grassmann algebra, an operation that is needed to express the property of matter usually represented by means of ε and μ.},

There has been significant progress in the classical Radon problem when manifolds are hyperplanes and the weight function is the unity; there are interesting results in the plane case when a family of curves is regular (resembling locally the family of straight lines) or in case of the family of straight lines with an arbitrary regular attenuation. Still there are many interesting open questions about the problem with local data and simultaneous recovery of density of a source and of attenuation.

Here we introduce a generalized Cauchy-Riemann operator, often called a Dirac operator, and the analogues of holomorphic functions. These functions are called Clifford holo-morphic functions or monogenic functions. We give a generalization of Cauchy’s theorem and Cauchy’s integral formula. Using Cauchy’s theorem, we can establish the Möbius invariance of monogenic functions. We will also introduce the Plemelj formulas and operators, and Hardy spaces.},

Brevity, clarity, and scope make this classic book an excellent introduction to more complex ideas from geometric measure theory and the calculus of variations for beginning graduate students and researchers. Morgan emphasizes geometry over proofs and technicalities, providing a fast and efficient insight into many aspects of the subject, with new coverage to this edition including topical coverage of the Log Convex Density Conjecture, a major new theorem at the center of an area of mathematics that has exploded since its appearance in Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture, and new topical coverage of manifolds taking into account all recent research advances in theory and applications. Focuses on core geometry rather than proofs, paving the way to fast and efficient insight into an extremely complex topic in geometric structures Enables further study of more advanced topics and texts Demonstrates in the simplest possible way how to relate concepts of geometric analysis by way of algebraic or topological techniques Contains full topical coverage of The Log-Convex Density Conjecture Comprehensively updated throughout},
