	abstract = {As was shown by Lassas and Uhlmann [Ann. Sci. E´cole Norm. Sup. (4), 34 (2001), pp. 771–787], the smooth two-dimensional compact orientable Riemann manifold with the boundary is uniquely determined by its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (DN-map) up to conformal equivalence. We give a new proof of this fact based on relations between the Calderon problem and function algebras: the manifold is identiﬁed with the spectrum of the algebra of holomorphic functions determined by the DN-map up to isometry; as such, the manifold is recovered from the DN-map by the use of the Gelfand transform. A simple formula linking the DN-map to the Euler characteristic of the manifold is derived.},

Algebra E is generated by the so-called eikonals, which are self-adjoint operators related with reachable sets of the system. Its structure is the main subject of the paper. We show that E is a direct sum of ”elementary blocks”. Each block is an algebra of operators, which multiply Rn-valued functions by continuous matrix-valued functions of special kind. The eikonal algebra is determined by the boundary inverse data. This shows promise of its possible applications to inverse problems.},

This book is a study of the Hodge-Kodaira and related decompositions on manifolds with boundary under mainly analytic aspects. It aims at developing a method for solving boundary value problems. Analysing a Dirichlet form on the exterior algebra bundle allows to give a refined version of the classical decomposition results of Morrey. A projection technique leads to existence and regularity theorems for a wide class of boundary value problems for differential forms and vector fields. The book links aspects of the geometry of manifolds with the theory of partial differential equations. It is intended to be comprehensible for graduate students and mathematicians working in either of these fields.},

	title = {Spectral exterior calculus},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01209},
	abstract = {A spectral approach to building the exterior calculus in manifold learning problems is developed. The spectral approach is shown to converge to the true exterior calculus in the limit of large data. Simultaneously, the spectral approach decouples the memory requirements from the amount of data points and ambient space dimension. To achieve this, the exterior calculus is reformulated entirely in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator on functions. The exterior derivatives of these eigenfunctions (and their wedge products) are shown to form a frame (a type of spanning set) for appropriate \$L{\textasciicircum}2\$ spaces of \$k\$-forms, as well as higher-order Sobolev spaces. Formulas are derived to express the Laplace-de Rham operators on forms in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian on functions. By representing the Laplace-de Rham operators in this frame, spectral convergence results are obtained via Galerkin approximation techniques. Numerical examples demonstrate accurate recovery of eigenvalues and eigenforms of the Laplace-de Rham operator on 1-forms. The correct Betti numbers are obtained from the kernel of this operator approximated from data sampled on several orientable and non-orientable manifolds, and the eigenforms are visualized via their corresponding vector fields. These vector fields form a natural orthonormal basis for the space of square-integrable vector fields, and are ordered by a Dirichlet energy functional which measures oscillatory behavior. The spectral framework also shows promising results on a non-smooth example (the Lorenz 63 attractor), suggesting that a spectral formulation of exterior calculus may be feasible in spaces with no differentiable structure.},

In this article, we study the relationships among various ring-theoretic properties and topological conditions on Spec r (R) (with weak Zariski topology). A ring R is called Abelian if all idempotents in R are central (see Goodearl, 1991). A ring R is called 2-primal if every nilpotent element is in the prime radical of R (see Lam, 2001). It will be shown that for an Abelian ring R there is a bijection between the set of all idempotents in R and the clopen (i.e., closed and open) sets in Spec r (R). And the following results are obtained for any ring R: (1) For any clopen set U in Spec r (R), there is an idempotent e in R such that U = U r (eR). (2) If R is an Abelian ring or a 2-primal ring, then, for any idempotent e in R, U r (eR) is a clopen set in Spec r (R). (3) Spec r (R) is connected if and only if Spec(R) is connected.},

	title = {Introductory {Cliﬀord} analysis},
	abstract = {In this chapter an introduction is given to Cliﬀord analysis and the underlying Cliﬀord algebras. The functions under consideration are deﬁned on Euclidean space and take values in the universal real or complex Cliﬀord algebra, the structure and properties of which are also recalled in detail. The function theory is centered around the notion of a monogenic function, which is a null solution of a generalized Cauchy–Riemann operator, which is rotation invariant and factorizes the Laplace operator. In this way, Cliﬀord analysis may be considered both as a generalization to higher dimension of the theory of holomorphic functions in the complex plane and a reﬁnement of classical harmonic analysis. A notion of monogenicity may also be associated to the vectorial part of the Cauchy-Riemann operator, which is called the Dirac operator; some attention is paid to the intimate relation between both notions. Since a product of monogenic functions is, in general, no longer monogenic, it is crucial to possess some tools for generating monogenic functions: such tools are provided by Fueter’s theorem on the one hand and the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya extension theorem on the other. A corner stone in this function theory is the Cauchy integral formula for representation of a monogenic function in the interior of its domain of monogenicity. Starting from this representation formula and related integral formulae, it is possible to consider integral transforms such as Cauchy, Hilbert and Radon transforms, which are important both within the theoretical framework and in view of possible applications.},

A short introduction to geometric algebra is included in the text. The theory that results from this extension is simpler and more powerful than either differential forms or tensor methods, in a number of ways. The multivector directional derivative obeys a powerful product rule. Simple conditions are obtained for metric-compatibility and torsion-freeness of the connection coefficients, and derivatives with torsion are treated generally. The covariant derivative of tensor fields is derived from a simple chain rule. Arbitrary metric signatures are treated in generality. The curved-manifold equivalents of the gradient, divergence, and curl operators are investigated, and the torsion-free curl is shown to be equivalent to the exterior derivative of differential forms. Unlike most traditional treatments, the entire formalism is developed in terms of completely arbitrary vector bases, which might be neither coordinate bases nor orthonormal. Methods of geometric algebra have previously been applied to vector calculus with great success, and extended to curved spaces in several ways (notably including ``vector manifolds'' and ``gauge theory gravity''). Here we provide a new way of extending geometric calculus to curved manifolds, which more closely parallels standard Riemannian geometry.},

	abstract = {Formulas relating dot and cross products of vectors to their angle are generalized for products of real or complex blades (simple multivectors). Their inner product and contraction are related to a Grassmann angle, the exterior product to a complementary Grassmann angle, and products of Cliﬀord geometric algebra are also linked to such angles. We interpret geometrically the Cliﬀord product of blades and some of its properties, relate it to an angle bivector, and give a formula for the exponential of any bivector in terms of Grassmann angles. The relations between such angles and blade products cast new light on both and reveal new properties.},

	abstract = {This is an introduction to geometric algebra, an alternative to traditional vector algebra that expands on it in two ways: 1. In addition to scalars and vectors, it defines new objects representing subspaces of any dimension. 2. It defines a product that's strongly motivated by geometry and can be taken between any two objects. For example, the product of two vectors taken in a certain way represents their common plane. This system was invented by William Clifford and is more commonly known as Clifford algebra. It's actually older than the vector algebra that we use today (due to Gibbs) and includes it as a subset. Over the years, various parts of Clifford algebra have been reinvented independently by many people who found they needed it, often not realizing that all those parts belonged in one system. This suggests that Clifford had the right idea, and that geometric algebra, not the reduced version we use today, deserves to be the standard "vector algebra." My goal in these notes is to describe geometric algebra from that standpoint and illustrate its usefulness. The notes are work in progress; I'll keep adding new topics as I learn them myself.},

We think the basis for a better arithmetic has long been available, but its versatility has hardly been appreciated, and it has not yet been integrated into the mainstream of mathematics. We refer to the system commonly called 'Clifford Algebra', though we prefer the name 'Geometric Algebm' suggested by Clifford himself. Many distinct algebraic systems have been adapted or developed to express geometric relations and describe geometric structures. Especially notable are those algebras which have been used for this purpose in physics, in particular, the system of complex numbers, the quatemions, matrix algebra, vector, tensor and spinor algebras and the algebra of differential forms. Each of these geometric algebras has some significant advantage over the others in certain applications, so no one of them provides an adequate algebraic structure for all purposes of geometry and physics. At the same time, the algebras overlap considerably, so they provide several different mathematical representations for individual geometrical or physical ideas.},

	abstract = {Let \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr A\}(D)\$ be an algebra of functions continuous in the disk \$D={\textbackslash}\{z{\textbackslash}in\{{\textbackslash}mathbb C\}{\textbackslash},{\textbar}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},{\textbar}z{\textbar}{\textbackslash}leqslant 1{\textbackslash}\}\$ and \{{\textbackslash}it holomorphic\} into \$D\$. The well-known fact is that the set \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr M\}\$ of its characters (homomorphisms \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr A\}(D){\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}mathbb C\$) is exhausted by the Dirac measures \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}delta\_\{z\_0\}{\textbackslash},{\textbar}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},z\_0{\textbackslash}in D{\textbackslash}\}\$ and a homeomorphism \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr M\}{\textbackslash}cong D\$ holds. We present a 3d analog of this classical result as follows. Let \$B={\textbackslash}\{x{\textbackslash}in\{{\textbackslash}mathbb R\}{\textasciicircum}3{\textbackslash},{\textbar}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},{\textbar}x{\textbar}{\textbackslash}leqslant 1{\textbackslash}\}\$. A quaternion field is a pair \$p={\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}alpha,u{\textbackslash}\}\$ of a function \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and vector field \$u\$ in the ball \$B\$. A field \$p\$ is \{{\textbackslash}it harmonic\} if \${\textbackslash}alpha, u\$ are continuous in \$B\$ and \${\textbackslash}nabla{\textbackslash}alpha=\{{\textbackslash}rm rot{\textbackslash},\}u,{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm div{\textbackslash},\}u=0\$ holds into \$B\$. The space \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr Q\}(B)\$ of such fields is not an algebra w.r.t. the relevant (point-wise quaternion) multiplication. However, it contains the commutative algebras \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr A\}\_{\textbackslash}omega(B)={\textbackslash}\{p{\textbackslash}in\{{\textbackslash}mathscr Q\}(B){\textbackslash},{\textbar}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}nabla\_{\textbackslash}omega{\textbackslash}alpha=0,{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}nabla\_{\textbackslash}omega u=0{\textbackslash}\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},({\textbackslash}omega{\textbackslash}in S{\textasciicircum}2)\$, each \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr A\}\_{\textbackslash}omega(B)\$ being isometrically isomorphic to \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr A\}(D)\$. This enables one to introduce a set \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr M\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbb H\}\$ of the \${\textbackslash}mathbb H\$-valued linear functionals on \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr Q\}(B)\$ (\{{\textbackslash}it \${\textbackslash}mathbb H\$-characters\}), which are multiplicative on each \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr A\}\_{\textbackslash}omega(B)\$, and prove that \$\{{\textbackslash}mathscr M\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbb H\}={\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}delta{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbb H\}\_\{x\_0\}{\textbackslash},{\textbar}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},x\_0{\textbackslash}in B{\textbackslash}\}{\textbackslash}cong B\$, where \${\textbackslash}delta{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbb H\}\_\{x\_0\}(p)=p(x\_0)\$.},

In this paper we bridge the gap by showing that classical integral-geometric formulas such as those of Crofton, Cauchy, and Chern can be easily and systematically obtained through the study of Radon-type transforms on double fibrations. The methods also allow us to extend these formulas to non-homogeneous settings where group-theoretic techniques are no longer useful. To illustrate this point, we construct all Finsler metrics on projective space such that hyperplanes are area-minimizing and extend the theory of Crofton densities developed by Busemann, Pogorelov, Gelfand, and Smirnov.Pensar es olvidar diferencias. . .Jorge Luis Borges},

	abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to describe the settings in which one can set up coherent generalizations to several variables of the classical single variable complex analysis and to point out some basic properties of the function spaces that naturally occur in such settings. Particular emphasis is placed on defining proper counterparts in higher dimension of the concept of holomorphic functions and of the Cauchy–Riemann operator. The resulting function theory deals with monogenic functions and Euclidean Dirac or Cauchy–Riemann operators. Its richness is illustrated by the existence of a general Cauchy–Pompeiu Integral Representation Formula. Actually, even more general formulas will be initially derived for first order homogeneous differential operators with constant coefficients in a unital associative Banach algebra. The point that will be made is that the operators and algebras that yield the simplest forms of such Integral Representation Formulas with Remainders are essentially the Cauchy–Riemann and Dirac operators associated with Euclidean Clifford algebras. As yet another generalization of a classical result in single variable complex analysis one gets a Quantitative Hartogs–Rosenthal Theorem concerned with uniform approximation on compact sets by monogenic functions. An equally important goal of the chapter is to outline some of the contributions that led to the discovery and development of Quaternion and Clifford analysis. The last section includes several concluding remarks and a few additional references that outline the full scope of some of the early and current developments, and help in further explorations of other lines of research in quaternion and Clifford analysis.},

	abstract = {In [4] Fueter describes a method for characterizing homogeneous polynomial solutions to the quaternionic analogue of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. In [3] Delanghe demonstrates that this method may be generalized to characterize homogeneous polynomial solutions to a generalized Cauchy-Riemann equation defined over a Clifford algebra. The function theory associated with this particular equation has been extensively pursued in recent years by a number of authors (eg [2,5,7,8,9,10]). However, the author shows in [7] that the methods used in [3,4] may be extended to characterize homogeneous polynomial solutions to homogeneous, first order, constant coefficient differential equations defined over arbitrary, finite dimensional, associative algebras with identity. For this reason it would appear desirable to find another method to characterize these solutions, to generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations over Clifford algebras, which is more closely aligned to the properties of Clifford algebras.In this paper another approach is adopted to characterize homogeneous polynomial solutions, in even dimensions, of the equations considered by Delanghe in [3]. It is demonstrated that these polynomials form an orthogonal basis with respect to the inner product introduced, by Sommen [8] for solutions to the homogeneous Dirac equation in Rn. Moreover, the method used here to introduce the inner product makes use of a natural automorphism within the Clifford algebra and bypasses the inversion transform employed in [8]. We also show that these basis elements contain all homogeneous polynomial solutions to the split Dirac equations described by Sommen in [9]. We conclude by giving a local characterization of the solutions to these split Dirac equations in terms of canonical isomorphisms between Clifford algebras and tensor products of lower dimensional Clifford algebras.},

We will give a representation formula of the second kind using differential forms. Another topic is the study of the domains of bi- regularity which are the analogues of the domains of holomorphy of complex analysis. We will make it clear that multi-valued functions cannot be avoided in this study. Some examples of domains of biregula- rity will be given, by constructing biregular functions in the domains which cannot be extended to any larger domain.},

Grassmann algebra with the (pseudo-) Riemannian structure (including degenerate case), or with the (pre-) symplectic structure, or with the Hermitian (Hilbert) structure, contain the corresponding Riemannian or symplectic or Hermitian Clifford algebra. 2. Grassmann algebra is the tautology of the formalism of the (multi-) fermion and antifermion creation and annihilation operators. This relation does not need at all to fix any kind of the Riemannian (Euclidean) or Hilbertian, Hermitian, etc, structures. 3. Clifford algebra is the tautology of the formalism of the quasi-particles in nuclear physics and therefore can be viewed as the Bogoliubov transformation of the Grassmann algebra. 4. The last two statements open wide possibilities of the applications of the Grassmann and Hermitian Clifford algebras particularly to nucleons and quarks in the nuclear shell theory. 5. The Clifford product can always be reexpressed in terms of the fermion creation and annihilation operators. 6. It is interesting that symplectic Clifford algebras has not yet been explored in the classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics.},

Such spinors are called pure. Chevalley later gave a thorough treatment of pure spinors. In Cartan’s treatment the vector space was over the complex field. Chevalley allowed an arbitrary field but assumed the quadratic form to be of maximal index (i.e. the totally isotropic subspaces have the largest possible dimension). I will firstly show how the notion of pure spinors may be extended to the case of a real vector space whose metric has a signature with r + 2 (r) plus (minus) signs; the pure spinors being in correspondence with oriented isotropic (r + l)-planes. For r = 1 all spinors are pure. As an example of how this may be used I shall show how to find Lorentzian manifolds for which the Kahler equation admits spinorial solutions. Similarly all Lorentzian manifolds admitting parallel spinors may be found, giving possible background geometries for supersymmetry.},

This new equation, invented by Sauter, provides a framework in which only the algebraic properties of the matrix operators and wave functions are needed for all calculations in relativistic quantum mechanics.},

The formulation provides examples of physical quantities which can be usefully described by multivector aggregates, i.e. sums of unlike geometries. The equation of motion of the harmonic oscillator is “geometrized” by being factored into a first order multivector differential equation. This is analogous to factoring the (relativistic) Klein-Gordon equation into the linear Dirac equation by the use of Dirac matrices. The solution is a special “geometric phasor”, which is analogous to the complex phasor of standard theory, however the timelike vector eO, replaces the usual imaginary “1”. The geometric phasor is reinterpreted as a vector in a particular two- dimensional subalgebra which has the properties of a geometric phase space. Clifford Algebraic velocity (timelike bivector) and position are found to be naturally perpendicular in the phase space.A single multivector conservation equation containing all the conserved quantities of the system is derived directly from the multivector equation of motion. The formulation is a classical discrete mechanical analog of the relativistic quantum results put forward by Greider3 and Ross2. A continuum generalization allows for a R(4) formulation Dirac theory. The R(4) algebra [of spacetime] used here is one dimension less than the C(4) [five dimensional] algebra used in standard Dirac theory.},

The continuity equations must yield physically meaningful conservation laws in order to produce classical fields which also are physically meaningful and correct. Specifically, the charge-current conservation equation leads directly to the correct classical Maxwell electromagnetic equations if the sign of the charge is indefinite. Similarly, the energy-momentum conservation equation leads to a classical theory of gravity if the sign of the energy tensor is positive-definite.

While it is necessary to use Clifford algebra in quantum mechanics in splitting up the Schrödinger equation to get the Dirac equation, it is not necessary to use Clifford algebra in electromagnetic theory or network theory. However, as Clifford algebra is the natural tool to use in connection with, for example, the Minkowski model of Lorentz space, it is quite useful in studying problems dealing with partially polarized waves (the Stokes vector), active, lossy, and noisy networks, etc. Some applications of Clifford algebra in electromagnetic theory and network theory will be discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper presents some points of comparison between Grassmann and Clifford algebras in their applications to electromagnetics. The Grassmann algebra applies directly to (exterior) differential forms leading to Cartan’s calculus. Forms of various degrees correspond most naturally to electromagnetic quantities and their relations are expressed by means of the exterior differential operator d.These relations are conveniently represented either in space or space-time by flow diagrams. They reveal the existence of potentials (Poincaré’s Lemma), the independence from coordinate systems, and the role of the metric. All of these properties are briefly reviewed. A calculus for functions having their values in a Clifford algebra can also be developed based on the Dirac operator D, whose square is a generalized Laplacian. Besides its role in Dirac’s theory of the electron, this Clifford calculus can also be adapted to electromagnetics, although less directly than with Cartan’s calculus. The point of departure is the role of a metric in a Clifford algebra. This can be remedied by introducing the Hodge star operator in the Grassmann algebra, an operation that is needed to express the property of matter usually represented by means of ε and μ.},

There has been significant progress in the classical Radon problem when manifolds are hyperplanes and the weight function is the unity; there are interesting results in the plane case when a family of curves is regular (resembling locally the family of straight lines) or in case of the family of straight lines with an arbitrary regular attenuation. Still there are many interesting open questions about the problem with local data and simultaneous recovery of density of a source and of attenuation.

Here we introduce a generalized Cauchy-Riemann operator, often called a Dirac operator, and the analogues of holomorphic functions. These functions are called Clifford holo-morphic functions or monogenic functions. We give a generalization of Cauchy’s theorem and Cauchy’s integral formula. Using Cauchy’s theorem, we can establish the Möbius invariance of monogenic functions. We will also introduce the Plemelj formulas and operators, and Hardy spaces.},

This paper is concerned with the meeting point of these areas: Dirac operators on Riemannian (or conformal spin) manifolds with boundary. The analysis of this situation is developed in direct analogy with function theory in the plane. A number of classical results from complex analysis, and their counterparts in Clifford analysis, are shown to extend to Dirac operators on manifolds, including the Cauchy integral formula, the Plemelj and Pompeiu formulae, the Kerzman-Stein formula, and the L²-boundedness of the Cauchy and Hilbert transforms. Finally, the null space of the Dirac operator on a conformal spin manifold is shown to define a conformally invariant Hilbert space of boundary values, such that the norm of the pointwise evaluation of solutions on the interior gives rise to a co...},

For example, we study PlemeljCalder´on-Seeley-Bojarski type splittings of Cauchy boundary data into traces of ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ monogenics and show that this problem has ﬁnite index. We also consider Szeg¨o projections and the corresponding Lp-decompositions. Our approach relies on an extension of the classical Caldero´nZygmund theory of singular integral operators which allows one to consider Cauchy type operators with variable kernels on Lipschitz graphs. In the second part, where we explore connections with Maxwell’s equations, the main novelty is the treatment of the corresponding electro-magnetic boundary value problem by recasting it as a ‘half’ Dirichlet problem for a suitable Dirac operator.},

Basically this is due to the fact that points in the complex plane are represented by complex numbers. This way one can express vector addition, rotations (by multiplication with a complex number with modulus 1), reflection in the real axis (by the mapping z → {\textbackslash}( {\textbackslash}bar\{z\} {\textbackslash}) ) and others in a straightforward way. In this chapter Clifford algebras (sometimes called geometrical algebras) are introduced, which allow similar constructs for dimensions greater than two. Unfortunately some properties of the complex number field, such as commutativity or the existence of an inverse for every nonzero number, are lost. On the other hand, Clifford algebras allow the manipulation of several notions which are specific to higher dimensional geometry, such as k-blades. Basically, a Clifford algebra is constructed from a finite-dimensional space with a scalar product (not necessarily positive definite), introducing an algebra multiplication which both reflects the properties of this scalar product and of the outer product.},

We then have the question of how to obtain the monogenic function if the boundary values are known. It may seem surprising at first that the Cauchy kernel of the previous chapter plays an important role here. However, as we shall see, there is a fundamental pattern underlying both the Cauchy kernel and the boundary value problem. The Cauchy kernel Cx is the result of applying {\textbackslash}( \{{\textbackslash}not\{{\textbackslash}nabla \}{\textasciicircum}\{\{*\{{\textbackslash}rm\{inv\}\}\}\}\} {\textbackslash}) to point evaluation δx. Reconstruction of a monogenic function from its boundary value is equivalent to applying {\textbackslash}( \{{\textbackslash}not\{{\textbackslash}nabla \}{\textasciicircum}\{\{*\{{\textbackslash}rm\{inv\}\}\}\}\} {\textbackslash}) to a linear functional associated with boundary values. So we have to use a function space on the manifold N on which this linear functional is continuous, and which can act as the image space of {\textbackslash}( \{{\textbackslash}not\{{\textbackslash}nabla \}{\textasciicircum}\{\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{inv\}\}\}\}\} {\textbackslash}).

	abstract = {Euclidean Cliﬀord analysis is a higher dimensional function theory oﬀering a reﬁnement of classical harmonic analysis. The theory is centred around the concept of monogenic functions, which constitute the kernel of a ﬁrst order vector valued, rotation invariant, diﬀerential operator ∂ called the Dirac operator, which factorizes the Laplacian. More recently, Hermitean Cliﬀord analysis has emerged as a new branch of Cliﬀord analysis, oﬀering yet a reﬁnement of the Euclidean case; it focusses on a subclass of monogenic functions, i.e. the simultaneous null solutions, called Hermitean (or h–) monogenic functions, of two Hermitean Dirac operators ∂z and ∂z† which are invariant under the action of the unitary group, and constitute a splitting of the original Euclidean Dirac operator. In Euclidean Cliﬀord analysis, the Cliﬀord–Cauchy integral formula has proven to be a corner stone of the function theory, as is the case for the traditional Cauchy formula for holomorphic functions in the complex plane. Also a Hermitean Cliﬀord–Cauchy integral formula has been established by means of a matrix approach. Naturally Cauchy integral formulae rely upon the existence of fundamental solutions of the Dirac operators under consideration. The aim of this paper is twofold. We want to reveal the underlying structure of these fundamental solutions and to show the particular results hidden behind a formula such as e.g. ∂E = δ. Moreover we will reﬁne these relations by constructing fundamental solutions for the diﬀerential operators issuing from the Euclidean and Hermitean Dirac operators by splitting the Cliﬀord algebra product into its dot and wedge parts.},

	abstract = {We consider a compact, oriented, smooth Riemannian manifold M (with or without boundary) and we suppose G is a torus acting by isometries on M. Given X in the Lie algebra of G and corresponding vector field XM on M, one defines Wittenʼs inhomogeneous coboundary operator dXM=d+ιXM:ΩG±→ΩG∓ (even/odd invariant forms on M) and its adjoint δXM. Witten (1982) [18] showed that the resulting cohomology classes have XM-harmonic representatives (forms in the null space of ΔXM=(dXM+δXM)2), and the cohomology groups are isomorphic to the ordinary de Rham cohomology groups of the set N(XM) of zeros of XM. Our principal purpose is to extend these results to manifolds with boundary. In particular, we define relative (to the boundary) and absolute versions of the XM-cohomology and show the classes have representative XM-harmonic fields with appropriate boundary conditions. To do this we present the relevant version of the Hodge–Morrey–Friedrichs decomposition theorem for invariant forms in terms of the operators dXM and δXM. We also elucidate the connection between the XM-cohomology groups and the relative and absolute equivariant cohomology, following work of Atiyah and Bott. This connection is then exploited to show that every harmonic field with appropriate boundary conditions on N(XM) has a unique XM-harmonic field on M, with corresponding boundary conditions. Finally, we define the XM-Poincaré duality angles between the interior subspaces of XM-harmonic fields on M with appropriate boundary conditions, following recent work of DeTurck and Gluck.},

Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in imaging the distribution of electrical impedance through the technique of electrical impedance tomography (EIT). However, EIT has a number of practical problems relating to the placement of electrodes on the body. Such contacts are not required to collect magnetic field data around an object through which current is flowing and thus this approach may be more practical than EIT in the clinical environment. This paper describes the technique of magnetic impedance tomography (MIT), which allows reconstruction of the current distribution from magnetic field measurements. The reconstruction techniques used to generate the images and the prototype data collection system are described. Images produced using data collected from discrete and distributed current phantoms and the thorax during human respiration are presented.},

If we know all the arrival times at the boundary cylinder of the spacetime, can we reconstruct the space, a Riemannian manifold with boundary? With a finite set of sources we can only hope to get an approximate reconstruction, and we indeed provide a discrete metric approximation to the manifold with explicit data-driven error bounds when the manifold is simple. This is the geometrization of a seismological inverse problem where we measure the arrival times on the surface of waves from an unknown number of unknown interior microseismic events at unknown times. The closeness of two metric spaces with a marked boundary is measured by a labeled Gromov--Hausdorff distance. If measurements are done for infinite time and spatially dense sources, our construction produces the true Riemannian manifold and the finite-time approximations converge to it in the metric sense.},

This paper is concerned with the meeting point of these areas: Dirac operators on Riemannian (or conformal spin) manifolds with boundary. The analysis of this situation is developed in direct analogy with function theory in the plane. A number of classical results from complex analysis, and their counterparts in Clifford analysis, are shown to extend to Dirac operators on manifolds, including the Cauchy integral formula, the Plemelj and Pompeiu formulae, the Kerzman-Stein formula, and the L²-boundedness of the Cauchy and Hilbert transforms. Finally, the null space of the Dirac operator on a conformal spin manifold is shown to define a conformally invariant Hilbert space of boundary values, such that the norm of the pointwise evaluation of solutions on the interior gives rise to a co...},

This extends the result of Lee and Uhlmann for the case \$k=0\$. The proof avoids the computation of the full symbol by using the calculus of pseudo-differential operators parametrized by a boundary normal coordinate and recursively calculating the principal symbol of the difference of boundary operators.},

Vector notation is by far the most widely used, particularly in applications. Of the more sophisticated notations, diﬀerential forms stand out as being close enough to vectors that most practitioners can readily understand the notation, yet at the same time oﬀering unique visualization tools and graphical insight into the behavior of ﬁelds and waves. We survey recent papers and book on diﬀerential forms and review the basic concepts, notation, graphical representations, and key applications of the diﬀerential forms notation to Maxwell’s equations and electromagnetic ﬁeld theory.},
