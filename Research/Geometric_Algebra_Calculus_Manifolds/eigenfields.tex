Consider the clifford-laplace-beltrami operator $\laplace$ and the eigen equation
\[
\laplace F = \lambda F.
\]

\subsection{Spinors on 2-dimensional Manifold}

If we let $F=f_0+f_2$ be an even clifford field on a 2-dimensional manifold, we are interested in the spectral equation
\[
\laplace F = \lambda F
\]
which is then
\[
\laplace f_0 + \laplace f_2 = \lambda f_0 + \lambda f_2,
\]
hence we are simultaneously diagonalizing the laplace operator.  For functions $f_0$, we have
\[
\delta d f_0 = \lambda f_0
\]
and for bivectors we simultaneously have
\[
(d\delta +\delta d)f_2 = \lambda f_2.
\]
Working in coordinates, we locally have $F(x,y)$ (use the definition of laplace beltrami in coordinates?)
