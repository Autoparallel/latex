        The problem of determining an unknown Riemannian manifold given the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) operator is known as the Calder\'on problem.  One method of solving this problem in the two dimensional case is through the Boundary Control method.  There, one uses the DN operator to construct a Banach algebra of holomorphic functions on the manifold. The Gelfand transform of this algebra is then homeomorphic to the manifold. In higher dimensions, we replace the complex field with a Clifford algebra and use the DN operator to determine a $\spingroup$ invariant space of monogenic multivector fields. Using a power series representation for monogenic fields, one decomposes the space of monogenics into products of commutative algebras of $(0+2)$-vector fields constant on translations of planes and monogenic in $\R^n$. Using this decomposition, we define spinor characters on the space of monogenic fields that correspond to Dirac measures on the manifold.  The set of these Dirac measures is then homeomorphic to the underlying manifold with the Gelfand topology.

\subsection{Cauchy and Poisson integrals}

In regions of $\R^n$, one can define a Cauchy integral operator and Hilbert transform for multivector fields.  The details of these integral operators are laid out in \cite{brackx_hilbert_2008}. Note that the authors there take the opposite signature to $\mathcal{G}_n$ and define the gradient operator as $\underline{\partial} = e_j \nabla_{e_j}$.  Thus, we have $\grad = g^{ij} \underline{\partial}$.  Nonetheless, the fundamental solution to $\grad$ is a vector field given by
\[
E(x) = \frac{1}{a_m} \frac{x}{|x|^m},
\]
for $x\in \R^n$.  This is clear to see if we take $e_i$ to be a (local) orthonormal basis
\begin{align*}
\grad \wedge E &= \frac{1}{a_m}  \left( \frac{1}{|x|^n} \nabla_{e_i} x^j + x^j \nabla_{e_i} \frac{1}{|x|^n} \right) e^i \wedge e_j\\
&= \left( \frac{1}{|x|^n} \delta_i^j -\frac{3x^ix^j}{|x|^{n+2}} \right) e^i \wedge e_j\\
&= -\frac{3x^i x^j}{|x|^{n+2}} e^i \wedge e_j &&\textrm{since $e^i \wedge e_i=0$}\\
&= 0 &&\textrm{since $e^j\wedge e_i = -e^i \wedge e_j$ for an orthonormal basis.}
\end{align*}
(see \url{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/811248/wedge-product-between-nonorthogonal-basis-and-its-reciprocal-basis-in-geometric}. This is also clear since $E$ is a radial field and thus has no curl. Then, let $B_{\epsilon}$ be the $n$-ball of radius $\epsilon$ centered at the origin and we have
\begin{align*}
\int_{B_\epsilon} \grad \cdot Ed \Omega &= \int_{S_\epsilon} E \cdot \nu d\Sigma\\
&=\frac{1}{a_n} \int_{S_\epsilon} \frac{x\cdot \frac{x}{|x|}}{|x|^n} d\Sigma\\
&= \frac{1}{a_n} \int_{S_\epsilon} \frac{1}{\epsilon^{n-1}} d\Sigma\\
&= \frac{1}{a_n} \int_{S_\epsilon} \frac{1}{\epsilon^{n-1}} \epsilon^{n-1} d\phi_1 d\phi_2 \cdots d\phi_{n-1}\\
&= 1.
\end{align*}

Let $\partial M = \Sigma$ and define now the $\G_n$ valued inner product on multivector fields $f,g \in L_2(\Sigma)$
\[
\innerproduct{f}{g} = \int_{\partial M} f(\zeta)g(\zeta)d\Sigma(\zeta).
\]
We can then define the \emph{Cauchy kernel} for $x\in M$ and $\zeta \in \partial M$ using the fundamental solution $E$ as
\[
C(\zeta, x) = -\frac{1}{a_n} \nu(\zeta) E(x-\zeta)
\]
where $\nu(\zeta)$ is the outward normal vector to the hypersurface $\Sigma = \partial M$. Note the inclusion of the minus sign is due to the signature of the inner product $g$. The Cauchy integral for $\phi \in L_2(\partial M)$ is then
\[
\cauchy[\phi](x) = \innerproduct{C(\zeta,x)}{\phi(\zeta)} =\frac{1}{a_n} \int_{\Sigma} \frac{\zeta-x}{|x-\zeta|^n} \nu(\zeta) \phi(\zeta) d\Sigma(\zeta).
\]
The most important properties of the Cauchy integral is that $\cauchy[\phi]$ is monogenic in $M$ and for a scalar function $\phi$, $\cauchy[\phi]$ is a paravector.  Specifically,
\begin{align*}
\cauchy[\phi](x) &= \frac{1}{a_n} \int_{\Sigma} \frac{\zeta-x}{|x-\zeta|^n} \nu(\zeta) \phi(\zeta) d\Sigma(\zeta)\\
&= \frac{1}{a_n} \left(\int_{\Sigma} \phi(\zeta) \frac{\zeta-x}{|x-\zeta|^n} \cdot \nu(\zeta) d\Sigma(\zeta) + \int_{\Sigma} \phi(\zeta) \frac{\zeta-x}{|x-\zeta|^n} \wedge \nu(\zeta) d\Sigma(\zeta)\right)
\end{align*}

Similarly, for the $n$-ball of radius $r$, $B_r \subset \R^n$, we have the \emph{Poisson kernel}
\[
P(\zeta,x) = \frac{1}{a_n}\frac{r^2-|x|^2}{r|x-\zeta|^n}.
\]
Notably, we have the Poisson integral
\[
\poisson[\phi](x) = \innerproduct{P(\zeta,x)}{\phi(\zeta)} = \frac{1}{a_n} \int_\Sigma \phi(\zeta) \frac{r^2-|x|^2}{r|x-\zeta|^n},
\]
which is harmonic on $B_r$ and extends continuously onto $\Sigma$. Briefly letting $g_{ij}=\delta_{ij}$, if we then consider the Cauchy integral over $\Sigma = \partial B_r = S_r$ then it is apparent that the Poisson integral deviates from the scalar part of the Cauchy integral as
\[
\proj{0}{\cauchy[\phi](x)} = \frac{1}{a_n} \int_\Sigma \phi(\zeta) \frac{r^2- x\cdot \xi}{r|x-\xi|^n} d\Sigma (\zeta).
\]
Sadly, this means that we do not have the boundary behavior of the Cauchy integral that we desire.  Namely, the $\iota^* \proj{0}{\cauchy[\phi](x)}\neq \phi$ in general. It is also worth noting that it is an open problem to determine a general form for the Poisson integral for other domains in $\R^n$. However, since $\cauchy[\phi](x)$ is monogenic, we have that the components are harmonic.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Prove that the Hilbert transforms are equivalent on traces of harmonic functions. Specifically, $Td\phi = d\psi$.  
    \item Discuss hardy spaces as closure of $\monogenics$. 
    \item $H^2=1$ on $L_2(\partial M)$ which should show we satisfy the theorem below.
\end{itemize}

Let $M\subset \R^3$ be a 

\subsection{Generating axial monogenics}

The following questions remain for a domain in $\R^3$.

\begin{question}
    For what boundary values $\varphi \in C_\infty(\Sigma)$ can we generate axial monogenics?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
    Do these boundary values exhaust the whole axial algebra $\algebra{\omega}$?
\end{question}

Fix an axis $\omega$ which defines the blade $B = \omega I$ and thus defines the $B$-plane in $\R^3$.  Then, let $f=u+\beta B$ be an $\omega$-axial monogenic.  We can then determine the boundary values for $f$ on $\Sigma$ by orthogonal projection onto the $B$-plane.  That is, we care only about the components of $f$ perpendicular to the axis $\omega$ and hence we take for $\zeta \in \Sigma$
\[
\zeta^\perp = \omega \omega \wedge \zeta = (x\cdot B)B^{-1}.
\]
showing the relationship between projection onto a plane and being orthogonal to an axis in $\R^3$. Specifically, this means that the relationship $f(x)=f(x+t\omega)$ can be written as
\[
f(x)=f((x\cdot B)B^{-1}),
\]
in that we only care about the portion of $x$ along the plane given by $B$.  Thus, for $\xi \in \Sigma$ we have
\[
f(\xi) = f((\xi \cdot B)B^{-1}).
\]

\textcolor{red}{So boundary values of axial monogenics are axial and...?.}

\begin{example}
    Consider the 3-dimensional example with $M=B_3$ and $\Sigma=S^2$.  Let $e_1,e_2,e_3$ be a global orthonormal basis and let $g_{ij}=\delta_{ij}$.  Then let $B=e_1 \wedge e_2$.  Then the paravector field $f(x^1,x^2,x^3)=x^1+x^2B$ is $e_3$-axial. Clearly we can see that $f(x^1,x^2,x^3+t)=f(x^1,x^2,x^3)$ for any $t$.  $f$ is also monogenic as one can show
    \[
        \grad f = e_1 + (e_2 \wedge e_3)I = e_1 - e_1 = 0.
    \]
    Indeed, this $f$ is none other than the complex function $f(z)=z$ with $B$ taking the role of the imaginary unit $i$. 

    Let $x=x^1e_1 + x^2e_2 + x^3e_3$.  Then, 
    \[
        B (x\cdot B) = (e_1e_2)( x^1e_2 -x^2 e_1 ) = x^1 e_1 + x^2 e_2.
    \] 
    Thus, for $\xi \in S^2$, we have $f(\xi)=\xi^1 +\xi^2 B$.
\end{example}

\todo[inline]{If we consider now every $\omega$-axial monogenic can be written as a power series, if we can construct $z$ we should be done...?}

It is clear that we can define a monogenic field $f=u+b$ via the Cauchy integral, but we then require $\nabla_\omega f = 0$.  Let $f=\cauchy[\varphi](x)$, then we must have
\[
\nabla_\omega \proj{0}{\cauchy[\varphi](x)} = 0 \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad \nabla_\omega \proj{2}{\cauchy[\varphi](x)}=0.
\]
The first condition yields
\[
0 = \int_\Sigma \frac{(\nu(\zeta)\cdot x) (\omega \cdot x)}{|x-\zeta|^2} \phi(\zeta) d\Sigma(\zeta).
\]


\begin{theorem}
    For any $\omega \in Gr(1,3)$ we have that $\algebra{\omega}\subset \monogenics$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \textcolor{red}{This seems to be saying that we need boundary values in some hardy space or something. They defined this conjugacy thing as $G$.}
    Fix a unit vector $\omega$.  We want to show that for any $f=u+b\in \algebra{\omega}$ that $\iota^* u=\phi$ satisfies \ref{eq:conjugacy_requirement}.  That is,
    \[
        G\phi = (\Lambda - d\Lambda^{-1}d) \phi = 0.
    \]
    Note that $\phi$ is the trace of a harmonic function, so this operator is well defined.  Note that the equation
    \[
        \Lambda \psi = d \phi
    \]
    has a solution
\end{proof}

\section{Radon transform and integral geometry}

I feel like there is some way to go from projection onto subspaces as a map to grassmannians and reconstructing the manifold.  It's like a morse function type of thing.  Radon transforms also come to mind.
