	abstract = {As was shown by Lassas and Uhlmann [Ann. Sci. E´cole Norm. Sup. (4), 34 (2001), pp. 771–787], the smooth two-dimensional compact orientable Riemann manifold with the boundary is uniquely determined by its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (DN-map) up to conformal equivalence. We give a new proof of this fact based on relations between the Calderon problem and function algebras: the manifold is identiﬁed with the spectrum of the algebra of holomorphic functions determined by the DN-map up to isometry; as such, the manifold is recovered from the DN-map by the use of the Gelfand transform. A simple formula linking the DN-map to the Euler characteristic of the manifold is derived.},

We show that E is a direct sum of ”elementary blocks”. Each block is an algebra of operators, which multiply Rn-valued functions by continuous matrix-valued functions of special kind. The eikonal algebra is determined by the boundary inverse data. This shows promise of its possible applications to inverse problems.},

This book is a study of the Hodge-Kodaira and related decompositions on manifolds with boundary under mainly analytic aspects. It aims at developing a method for solving boundary value problems. Analysing a Dirichlet form on the exterior algebra bundle allows to give a refined version of the classical decomposition results of Morrey. A projection technique leads to existence and regularity theorems for a wide class of boundary value problems for differential forms and vector fields. The book links aspects of the geometry of manifolds with the theory of partial differential equations. It is intended to be comprehensible for graduate students and mathematicians working in either of these fields.},

	title = {Spectral exterior calculus},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01209},
	abstract = {A spectral approach to building the exterior calculus in manifold learning problems is developed. The spectral approach is shown to converge to the true exterior calculus in the limit of large data. Simultaneously, the spectral approach decouples the memory requirements from the amount of data points and ambient space dimension. To achieve this, the exterior calculus is reformulated entirely in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator on functions. The exterior derivatives of these eigenfunctions (and their wedge products) are shown to form a frame (a type of spanning set) for appropriate \$L{\textasciicircum}2\$ spaces of \$k\$-forms, as well as higher-order Sobolev spaces. Formulas are derived to express the Laplace-de Rham operators on forms in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian on functions. By representing the Laplace-de Rham operators in this frame, spectral convergence results are obtained via Galerkin approximation techniques. Numerical examples demonstrate accurate recovery of eigenvalues and eigenforms of the Laplace-de Rham operator on 1-forms. The correct Betti numbers are obtained from the kernel of this operator approximated from data sampled on several orientable and non-orientable manifolds, and the eigenforms are visualized via their corresponding vector fields. These vector fields form a natural orthonormal basis for the space of square-integrable vector fields, and are ordered by a Dirichlet energy functional which measures oscillatory behavior. The spectral framework also shows promising results on a non-smooth example (the Lorenz 63 attractor), suggesting that a spectral formulation of exterior calculus may be feasible in spaces with no differentiable structure.},

In this article, we study the relationships among various ring-theoretic properties and topological conditions on Spec r (R) (with weak Zariski topology). A ring R is called Abelian if all idempotents in R are central (see Goodearl, 1991). A ring R is called 2-primal if every nilpotent element is in the prime radical of R (see Lam, 2001). It will be shown that for an Abelian ring R there is a bijection between the set of all idempotents in R and the clopen (i.e., closed and open) sets in Spec r (R). And the following results are obtained for any ring R: (1) For any clopen set U in Spec r (R), there is an idempotent e in R such that U = U r (eR). (2) If R is an Abelian ring or a 2-primal ring, then, for any idempotent e in R, U r (eR) is a clopen set in Spec r (R). (3) Spec r (R) is connected if and only if Spec(R) is connected.},

	title = {Introductory {Cliﬀord} analysis},
	abstract = {In this chapter an introduction is given to Cliﬀord analysis and the underlying Cliﬀord algebras. The functions under consideration are deﬁned on Euclidean space and take values in the universal real or complex Cliﬀord algebra, the structure and properties of which are also recalled in detail. The function theory is centered around the notion of a monogenic function, which is a null solution of a generalized Cauchy–Riemann operator, which is rotation invariant and factorizes the Laplace operator. In this way, Cliﬀord analysis may be considered both as a generalization to higher dimension of the theory of holomorphic functions in the complex plane and a reﬁnement of classical harmonic analysis. A notion of monogenicity may also be associated to the vectorial part of the Cauchy-Riemann operator, which is called the Dirac operator; some attention is paid to the intimate relation between both notions. Since a product of monogenic functions is, in general, no longer monogenic, it is crucial to possess some tools for generating monogenic functions: such tools are provided by Fueter’s theorem on the one hand and the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya extension theorem on the other. A corner stone in this function theory is the Cauchy integral formula for representation of a monogenic function in the interior of its domain of monogenicity. Starting from this representation formula and related integral formulae, it is possible to consider integral transforms such as Cauchy, Hilbert and Radon transforms, which are important both within the theoretical framework and in view of possible applications.},

The key step is extending the tangent space at each point from a vector space to a geometric algebra, which is a linear space incorporating vectors with dot and wedge multiplication, and extending the affine connection to a directional derivative acting naturally on fields of multivectors (elements of the geometric algebra). A short introduction to geometric algebra is included in the text. The theory that results from this extension is simpler and more powerful than either differential forms or tensor methods, in a number of ways. The multivector directional derivative obeys a powerful product rule. Simple conditions are obtained for metric-compatibility and torsion-freeness of the connection coefficients, and derivatives with torsion are treated generally. The covariant derivative of tensor fields is derived from a simple chain rule. Arbitrary metric signatures are treated in generality. The curved-manifold equivalents of the gradient, divergence, and curl operators are investigated, and the torsion-free curl is shown to be equivalent to the exterior derivative of differential forms. Unlike most traditional treatments, the entire formalism is developed in terms of completely arbitrary vector bases, which might be neither coordinate bases nor orthonormal. Methods of geometric algebra have previously been applied to vector calculus with great success, and extended to curved spaces in several ways (notably including ``vector manifolds'' and ``gauge theory gravity''). Here we provide a new way of extending geometric calculus to curved manifolds, which more closely parallels standard Riemannian geometry.},

	abstract = {Formulas relating dot and cross products of vectors to their angle are generalized for products of real or complex blades (simple multivectors). Their inner product and contraction are related to a Grassmann angle, the exterior product to a complementary Grassmann angle, and products of Cliﬀord geometric algebra are also linked to such angles. We interpret geometrically the Cliﬀord product of blades and some of its properties, relate it to an angle bivector, and give a formula for the exponential of any bivector in terms of Grassmann angles. The relations between such angles and blade products cast new light on both and reveal new properties.},

	abstract = {This is an introduction to geometric algebra, an alternative to traditional vector algebra that expands on it in two ways: 1. In addition to scalars and vectors, it defines new objects representing subspaces of any dimension. 2. It defines a product that's strongly motivated by geometry and can be taken between any two objects. For example, the product of two vectors taken in a certain way represents their common plane. This system was invented by William Clifford and is more commonly known as Clifford algebra. It's actually older than the vector algebra that we use today (due to Gibbs) and includes it as a subset. Over the years, various parts of Clifford algebra have been reinvented independently by many people who found they needed it, often not realizing that all those parts belonged in one system. This suggests that Clifford had the right idea, and that geometric algebra, not the reduced version we use today, deserves to be the standard "vector algebra." My goal in these notes is to describe geometric algebra from that standpoint and illustrate its usefulness. The notes are work in progress; I'll keep adding new topics as I learn them myself.},

	abstract = {Matrix algebra has been called "the arithmetic of higher mathematics" [Be]. We think the basis for a better arithmetic has long been available, but its versatility has hardly been appreciated, and it has not yet been integrated into the mainstream of mathematics. We refer to the system commonly called 'Clifford Algebra', though we prefer the name 'Geometric Algebm' suggested by Clifford himself. Many distinct algebraic systems have been adapted or developed to express geometric relations and describe geometric structures. Especially notable are those algebras which have been used for this purpose in physics, in particular, the system of complex numbers, the quatemions, matrix algebra, vector, tensor and spinor algebras and the algebra of differential forms. Each of these geometric algebras has some significant advantage over the others in certain applications, so no one of them provides an adequate algebraic structure for all purposes of geometry and physics. At the same time, the algebras overlap considerably, so they provide several different mathematical representations for individual geometrical or physical ideas.},
