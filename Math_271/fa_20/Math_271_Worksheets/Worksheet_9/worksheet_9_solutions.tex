\begin{problem}
Consider the linear transformations on $\R^3$ to $\R^3$ given by
\begin{align*}
    R_x(\theta) &= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos\theta & -\sin \theta \\ 0 & \sin\theta & \cos \theta \end{pmatrix}\\
    R_y(\theta) &= \begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta & 0 & \sin \theta \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -\sin \theta & 0 & \cos \theta \end{pmatrix}\\
    R_z(\theta) &= \begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 \\ \sin \theta & \cos \theta  & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
\textbf{Fact:} These matrices are generators for the \emph{group of rotations} $\SO(3)$ of $\R^3$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Let $\theta = \pi/2$. Show that $R_x(\pi/2)$ rotates a vector counter clockwise by $\pi/2$ radians around the $x$-axis.
    \item Show that the determinant of each of these matrices is 1 for any value of $\theta$.
    \item Using properties of determinants, show that the determinant of a product of rotation matrices is also 1.
    \item Explain geometrically why a rotation matrix must have a determinant of 1.
    \item Show that $R_x(\theta)R_x(\theta)^\dagger = I$. This in fact true for any rotation matrix.
\end{enumerate}
