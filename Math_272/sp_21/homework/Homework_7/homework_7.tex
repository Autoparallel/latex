\begin{problem}
Previously we studied the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation. Now, we can take a look at the time-dependent version given by
\[
H \Psi(x,t) = i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x,t),
\]
where $H$ is the Hamiltonian operator.  Consider the situation for the free particle in the 1-dimensional box of length $L$ so that $V(x)=0$ and $\Psi(0,t)=0=\Psi(L,t)$.  
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Take a separation of variables ansatz and find a set of solutions (one for every positive integer $n$) to the time-dependent equation.
    \item Show that a super position of solutions is also a solution.
    \item For a single state $\psi_n(x,t)$, show that 
    \[
    \int_0^L \left|\psi_n(x,t)\right|^2 dx,
    \]
    is independent of $t$. This shows that the states $\psi_n$ are \emph{stationary} since their total probability does not depend on time.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
Maxwell's equations are given as
\begin{align*}
\grad \cdot \vecfieldB &= 0  & \grad \cdot \vecfieldE &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\\
\grad \times \vecfieldB -\mu_0 \epsilon_0\frac{\partial \vecfieldE}{\partial t}&=\mu_0 \vecfieldJ & \grad \times \vecfieldE + \frac{\partial \vecfieldB}{\partial t} &= \zerovec
\end{align*}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Look up each of the terms in the equations above and describe them.
    \item Describe what each equation is saying and why these are PDEs.
    \item In the absence of all charges we will have $\vecfieldJ=\zerovec$ and $\rho=0$.  Using that and the following two facts
    \[
    \veclaplace \vecfieldV = \grad (\grad \cdot \vecfieldV) - \grad \times (\grad \times \vecfieldV) \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad \grad \times \frac{\partial \vecfieldV}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\grad \times \vecfieldV),
    \]
    derive the vector wave equations for light
    \[
    \left( - \veclaplace + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial t^2}\right) \vecfieldE = \zerovec
    \]
    and
    \[
    \left( - \veclaplace + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial t^2}\right) \vecfieldB = \zerovec
    \]
    \item From the equations you derived, determine the wave speed of light in the vacuum, $c_0$.
\end{enumerate}
