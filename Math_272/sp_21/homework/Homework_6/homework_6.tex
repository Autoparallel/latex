\begin{problem} 
Let 
\[
\curvegamma(t) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(t) \\ \sin(t) \\ t \end{pmatrix}, \quad f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - 2z^2, \quad \vecfieldV(x,y,z) = \begin{pmatrix} x-y \\ y+x \\ z \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Compute derivatives of the following composite functions.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item $f(\curvegamma(t))$.
	\item $\vecfieldV(\curvegamma(t))$.
	\item $f(\vecfieldV(x,y,z))$.
\end{enumerate}
