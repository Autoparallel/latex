\section{Fourier Series}


the inner product for fourier series is different because it arises from group theory. Specifically, the inner product is a matter of a representation of a group.  So we have something like 
\[
\innprod{f}{g} = \frac{1}{|G|} \int_G f(x)g(x)dx
\]
So for this on $[0,L]$, we get
\[
\innprod{f}{g} = \frac{1}{L} \int_0^L f(x)g(x)dx.
\]
The orthonormal basis elements are the functions
\[
1, \qquad \sqrt{2}\cos\left(\frac{2n \pi x }{L}\right), \qquad \sqrt{2}\sin\left(\frac{2n \pi x}{L} \right).
\]

\section{Fourier Transforms}
\textcolor{red}{can find fundamental solution for the laplace operator at some point for electricity magnetism}

We can find the spectrum of the Laplace operator on $\R$ by
\[
\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = kf
\]
Then the characteristic polynomial is
\[
\lambda^2=k
\]
thus $\lambda = \pm \sqrt{k}$. Without going into extra detail, we know that $k\leq 0$ (this can be shown via integration by parts).  Thus, we have that the an eigenfunction for the Laplace operator can be written as
\[
f(x)=Ce^{\pm i\omega x}
\]
where $C$ is a constant.  Hence
