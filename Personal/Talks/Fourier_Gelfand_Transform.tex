\section{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontryagin_duality}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The table on fourier transforms on different domains, does this have anything to do with coverings and the fundamental group?
    \end{itemize}
    \item \url{http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2016/REUPapers/Su.pdf}
    \item Theorem. A locally compact abelian group G is compact if and only if the dual group ${\displaystyle {\widehat {G}}}$ is discrete. Conversely, $G$ is discrete if and only if ${\displaystyle {\widehat {G}}}$ is compact.
\end{itemize}
