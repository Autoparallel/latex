\noindent To those whom this may concern,

My name is Colin Roberts and I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in mathematics at Colorado State University (CSU) and Jack Christenson was a former student of mine. Over the past three years, I have tought a year long sequence course titled ``Applied Mathematics for Chemists I/II". This course serves as a specialized mathematics course for chemistry students at CSU and we cover a broad amount of topics including ordinary and partial differential equations, sequences and series, multivariate calculus, and Fourier theory. Jack joined me last year for the full sequence.

Jack did well throughout the course. Students to take 15 minute one-on-one oral examinations where they had to explain their solutions to provided problems and answer new questions they had not seen prior to the exam. Jack performed well in these sessions and showed his interest by asking his own questions. I should also note that he kept on top of his work and was very personable.
